# Challenge: Career Switch 2022

For this challenge we have to do a script to consume an API REST. This API provides us an array of data, and we need to sort it consuming a other endpoint. Also we can verify the sorted array using the same API too

## How to install

To install all dependencies run:
`npm i`

Then you need create .env file, in the root of project with the next data:

```
BASE_URL=<base url of API>
USER_MAIL=<mail of user>
```

## How to run

To run the script you only need to execute this command:
`npm run check`

## How to run tests

if you want to run all test cases:
`npm run test`
